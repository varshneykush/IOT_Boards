Arduino Home Automation System


# Project Overview
The Smart Home Automation System is an Arduino-based embedded solution that automates:

Door Control - Automatically opens the door when someone approaches.
Lighting Control - Manages lights based on ambient light and motion detection.
Gas Detection - Monitors gas levels and triggers an alarm if a dangerous concentration is detected.

This project provides real-time feedback via an LCD display, showing sensor data for user awareness.

# Features
Automatic Door Control: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a person near the door and opens it automatically.
Lighting Control: Activates lights based on ambient light and motion, conserving energy when lights are not needed.
Gas Leak Detection: Monitors gas concentration in the environment and triggers a buzzer alarm if gas levels exceed safe thresholds.
LCD Display: Displays sensor readings for real-time monitoring.
Alert System: Buzzer alerts users of any dangerous gas levels detected in the environment.
